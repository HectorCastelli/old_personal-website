# Setting up a new website

If you have followed me for the past years, you might have noticed that every so often I go ahead and redesign my website. Sometimes, the redesigns are also followed by a migration of the content, but usually not.

I am writing this article in hopes to both explain the reasoning behind this redesign, as well as sharing the learning that led to it. Comparing with more traditional development, I hope to use this article as a test, in my TDD journey of getting my new design out into production.

## Why my old website was not good enough?

I deeply believe in the need to keep reinventing ourselves and to stay current. Not changing and adapting after learning new things is a disservice to all the new knowledge I absorbed, and being so, I want to update the look, feel and content of my website to align better with _who I am now_.

The design goals and the objectives from my website from two years ago (2019) and my current objectives are no longer aligned. Back then, I was looking to show some of my personality and skills, and get into the job market. Right now, I want to create a safe space to publish my ramblings and sometimes unfinished thoughts.

## What should I focus on?

I believe the web has become bloated. A lot of effort and energy is being pumped into making UIs that are flashy, shiny and super dynamic, while other, more energy conscious means exist that satisfy the requirements (convey information, serve as a point of reference for all things "me").

At the same time, the widespread usage of pictographs to expand written language has made text even more powerful. Adding emotion and conveying intonation and intention has become much easier. _Great_ ðŸ’ƒ

These trends make me believe that there is no longer a need for personal blogs to be over-engineered. Text, pictographs and some images are enough to convey most of the content. Plus, they are easier to check for adaptability and accessibility.

## Is the technology stack important?

Not really, no. I chose to use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to power my website because I don't want to run a server myself, and [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) offers great support for it.

I can say tons of nice things about each of these tools, but the one thing that makes it superior in my point of view is that: I can incrementally build my site, with simplicity.
