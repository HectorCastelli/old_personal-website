# My Contact Information

## Email

For most inquiries, you can reach me at my personal e-mail: [hector.zacharias@gmail.com](mailto:hector.zacharias@gmail.com).

## Social Media

The only form of social media where I really am active is Twitter. But I do have a LinkedIn, if that sounds more appropriate to you:

- Twitter: [@ZektorH](https://twitter.com/zektorh)
- LinkedIn: [in/hectorzacharias](https://linkedin.com/in/hectorzacharias)

## Casual channels

**Please do not reach out to me in these channels if you want to talk about professional opportunities**

If you want to catch-up with me on a more casual environment, or if you wish to talk in "real-time" with me, feel free to chat with me on [Telegram](https://t.me/HectorCastelli).

There are other places where I interact with people:

- Discord: _hectorcastelli#1748_
- Steam: [HectorCastelli](https://steamcommunity.com/id/hectorcastz)

## FAQ

- How long do you usually take to respond?
  - It depends on the message, when it arrives and what is happening on my life. Normally, I respond to messages within 24 hours.
- Can I contact you about a professional opportunity?
  - Yes, although I am not really looking for new challenges at the moment.
- Can I contact you on your "casual" channels for professional opportunities?
  - No. If you do it, you will be ignored.
- Why don't you use WhatsApp instead of Telegram?
  - WhatsApp is part of an ecosystem that I do not support.
