# About Me

## Who am I?

I am **Hector**, a developer that likes solving (and sometimes creating) problems. I now live in sunny Barcelona with my wife Talita, and our cat Mavi üêà‚Äç‚¨õ. My pronouns are He/Him.

Most of my free time is spend working. ü§¶ Sometimes, I make games, as well as play them. Other times, I will be wasting away on the couch, binge-watching whichever anime series I got into recently.

## Career

If I were to talk about my whole career this page would become _very_ boring. Instead, I will summarize it in one sentence: More than a decade solving problems in multiple fields.

I am a polyglot developer, and I am proud in my ability to learn new technologies in a speedy way. I interest myself more in the problem at hand, and often leave the technological choices as such: choices aimed to enhance my comfort while solving the problem.
